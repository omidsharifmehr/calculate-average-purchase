For example, a soccer ball seller buys a certain number of balls each month.
The first month 10 balls The second month 20 balls.
So he bought two sets of balls.
In the next step, we enter the number of balls we bought in each series, and in the last step, the price of the balls in each series.
Finally,the average purchase of each ball is calculated.
